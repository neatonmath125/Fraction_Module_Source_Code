This is the source code for the Fraction Module. Source codes for the animations were gotten off of public pens on Codepen
and are  MIT Licensed. Individual licenses are in the directories of the levels with which the animation/code is used. To
see an overview of the directories/the references for the code that was used to help build the corresponding level, go to 
the "References" directory. The best effort was made to identiy each of the creators of the works and provide ample credit 
to them, but if you see source code missing/misidentifying the author, please contact us at neatonmath125@gmail.com and we 
will correct it right away.

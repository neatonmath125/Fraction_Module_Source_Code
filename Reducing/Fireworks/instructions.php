       <h1 class ="new" style="line-height:1.6; text-align:left; font-weight: normal;">Welcome to Firework Fractions! There are 6 levels of difficulty for this game, ranging from one to six stars. For each level you will have to answer 10 questions. You will have 20 seconds to answer each question. But wait, there’s a catch! You can earn a maximum of 10 points for each question, but the amount of points you get decreases by 2 every four seconds, so it is in your best interest to answer them quickly! Be warned, you get no points if you 1) don’t answer the question within the time limit or 2) answer it incorrectly. In order to pass a level, you have to get 60 or more points after the 10 questions. See if you can pass them all, good luck!!</h1>

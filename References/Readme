All of the animations were gotten off of public Pens on Codepen. All of the pens are MIT Liscensed. The MIT liscenses for the 
works are in the source code modules. View the "references.pdf" to quickly see where bits of the source code from the module
were gotten from. The best effort was made to identiy each of the creators of the works and provide ample credit to them, 
but if you see source code missing/misidentifying the author, please contact us at neatonmath125@gmail.com and we will
correct it right away.
